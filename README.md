# vim
Go vanilla, plugins will make you lazy and whatever you want plugins to accomplish can surely already be done in vanilla vim.

Nerdtree is OK, vanilla vim file navigation (explore) is not as good.

Remember the existence of `vimtutor` if you don't know vim

noterc is for quick annotations:
TESTED ONLY ON WINDOWS
TODO: '%:t' registry only works properly after opening the notes file twice

when loaded will go to the notes folder in the workspace and start navigation there
when editing a notes file use 'ttag' to insert '<YYYY/MM/DD> - (<SHORT FILE NAME>):'
