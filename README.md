# vim
You need to have several packages installed before running script
1. vim `apt-get install vim`
2. git `apt-get install git`
3. cmake `apt-get install build-install cmake`
4. python `apt-get install python-dev`
After that, just run
1. `git clone https://github.com/mrquorr/.vimgit.git`
2. `sudo ./install.sh`

Remember the existence of `vimtutor` if you don't know vim


Tested on Debian 8
Ubuntu and Mint should work as well
